 *
 * \ingroup host_color_correction

 *
 * In industrial imaging, white balance can fail due to the lack of a neutral reference in the image, such as when the
 * scene contains no gray or white areas, or when the colors are unevenly distributed (as in images dominated by a single color).
 * In these cases, traditional white balance algorithms, like the gray world method, may fail to produce accurate color corrections.
 *
 * Chromatic adaptation provides an alternative solution by adjusting the image’s colors based on the known or
 * estimated correlated color temperature of the light source.
 *
 * Refer to the IDS peak IPL documentation for additional information on Chromatic Adaptation.
 *
 * \note
 * If chromatic adaption is used in combination with white balance, the result is indefinite.
